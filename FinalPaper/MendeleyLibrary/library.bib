abstract = {Sequence-based variation in gene expression is a key driver of disease risk. Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40{\%} of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.},

abstract = {More than 90{\%} of common variants associated with complex traits do not affect proteins directly, but instead the circuits that control gene expression. This has increased the urgency of understanding the regulatory genome as a key component for translating genetic results into mechanistic insights and ultimately therapeutics. To address this challenge, we developed HaploReg (http://compbio.mit.edu/HaploReg) to aid the functional dissection of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results, the prediction of putative causal variants in haplotype blocks, the prediction of likely cell types of action, and the prediction of candidate target genes by systematic mining of comparative, epigenomic and regulatory annotations. Since first launching the website in 2011, we have greatly expanded HaploReg, increasing the number of chromatin state maps to 127 reference epigenomes from ENCODE 2012 and Roadmap Epigenomics, incorporating regulator binding data, expanding regulatory motif disruption annotations, and integrating expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) variants and their tissue-specific target genes from GTEx, Geuvadis, and other recent studies. We present these updates as HaploReg v4, and illustrate a use case of HaploReg for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-associated SNPs with putative brain regulatory mechanisms.},

abstract = {Identifying genetic correlations between complex traits and diseases can provide useful etiological insights and help prioritize likely causal relationships. The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use our method to estimate 300 genetic correlations among 25 traits, totaling more than 1.5 million unique phenotype measurements. Our results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia/ body mass index and associations between educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of a polygenic modeling framework, since there currently are no genome-wide significant SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.},

@article{Farrel2017,
abstract = {Background: Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to specific target DNA sites. Understanding how and where transcription factors bind at genome scale represents an essential step toward our understanding of gene regulation networks. Previously we developed a structure-based method for prediction of transcription factor binding sites using an integrative energy function that combines a knowledge-based multibody potential and two atomic energy terms. While the method performs well, it is not computationally efficient due to the exponential increase in the number of binding sequences to be evaluated for longer binding sites. In this paper, we present an efficient pentamer algorithm by splitting DNA binding sequences into overlapping fragments along with a simplified integrative energy function for transcription factor binding site prediction. Results: A DNA binding sequence is split into overlapping pentamers (5 base pairs) for calculating transcription factor-pentamer interaction energy. To combine the results from overlapping pentamer scores, we developed two methods, Kmer-Sum and PWM (Position Weight Matrix) stacking, for full-length binding motif prediction. Our results show that both Kmer-Sum and PWM stacking in the new pentamer approach along with a simplified integrative energy function improved transcription factor binding site prediction accuracy and dramatically reduced computation time, especially for longer binding sites. Conclusion: Our new fragment-based pentamer algorithm and simplified energy function improve both efficiency and accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first fragment-based method for structure-based transcription factor binding sites prediction.},

abstract = {Position weight matrices (PWMs) are the standard model for DNA and RNA regulatory motifs. In PWMs nucleotide probabilities are independent of nucleotides at other positions. Models that account for dependencies need many parameters and are prone to overfitting. We have developed a Bayesian approach for motif discovery using Markov models in which conditional probabilities of order k - 1 act as priors for those of order k This Bayesian Markov model (BaMM) training automatically adapts model complexity to the amount of available data. We also derive an EM algorithm for de-novo discovery of enriched motifs. For transcription factor binding, BaMMs achieve significantly (P = 1/16) higher cross-validated partial AUC than PWMs in 97{\%} of 446 ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets and improve performance by 36{\%} on average. BaMMs also learn complex multipartite motifs, improving predictions of transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites, bacterial pause sites, and RNA binding sites by 26-101{\%}. BaMMs never performed worse than PWMs. These robust improvements argue in favour of generally replacing PWMs by BaMMs.},

To help overcome this problem, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis in non-transformed peripheral blood samples from 5,311 individuals with replication in 2,775 individuals. We identified and replicated trans eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Some of these SNPs affect multiple genes in trans that are known to be altered in individuals with disease: rs4917014, previously associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), altered gene expression of C1QB and five type I interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE. DeepSAGE RNA sequencing showed that rs4917014 strongly alters the 3' UTR levels of IKZF1 in cis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analysis of the trans-regulated genes implicated IKZF1 as the causal gene. Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants.},

abstract = {The modelling of gene regulation is a major challenge in biomedical research. This process is dominated by transcription factors (TFs) and mutations in their binding sites (TFBSs) may cause the misregulation of genes, eventually leading to disease. The consequences of DNA variants on TF binding are modelled in silico using binding matrices, but it remains unclear whether these are capable of accurately representing in vivo binding. In this study, we present a systematic comparison of binding models for 82 human TFs from three freely available sources: JASPAR matrices, HT-SELEX-generated models and matrices derived from protein binding microarrays (PBMs). We determined their ability to detect experimentally verified “real” in vivo TFBSs derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data. As negative controls we chose random downstream exonic sequences, which are unlikely to harbour TFBS. All models were assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. While the area-under-curve was low for most of the tested models with only 47 {\%} reaching a score of 0.7 or higher, we noticed strong differences between the various position-specific scoring matrices with JASPAR and HT-SELEX models showing higher success rates than PBM-derived models. In addition, we found that while TFBS sequences showed a higher degree of conservation than randomly chosen sequences, there was a high variability between individual TFBSs. Our results show that only few of the matrix-based models used to predict potential TFBS are able to reliably detect experimentally confirmed TFBS. We compiled our findings in a freely accessible web application called ePOSSUM ($\backslash$n                    http:/mutationtaster.charite.de/ePOSSUM/$\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n                  ) which uses a Bayes classifier to assess the impact of genetic alterations on TF binding in user-defined sequences. Additionally, ePOSSUM provides information on the reliability of the prediction using our test set of experimentally confirmed binding sites.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a standard method for disease gene discovery. A substantial number of recent GWAS indicate that for most disorders, only a few common variants are implicated and the associated SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following a GWAS, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases. Reviews of published methods with recommendations for their application are provided within the framework for each approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coordinated European projects relying on standardized methods are needed to identify health inequalities across Europe. This study aimed to compare fitness, fatness, and cardiometabolic risk between urban adolescents from the south and center-north of Europe and to explore whether physical activity (PA) and other factors might explain these differences. METHODS: The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence cross-sectional project comprised 3528 adolescents from the south (4 cities) and central-north (6 cities) of Europe, 1089 of whom provided blood samples for analysis. Fitness (strength, speed-agility, and cardiorespiratory fitness), total and abdominal fatness (anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance), and cardiometabolic risk (z scores including fitness, fatness, blood lipids, insulin resistance, and blood pressure) were assessed. The analyses were adjusted for socioeconomic factors, objectively measured PA (accelerometry), total energy intake and diet quality, and genetic variants of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism. RESULTS: Adolescents from southern Europe were less fit and fatter according to all markers (P , .001). Differences in cardiometabolic risk scores were not consistent. Adolescents from the south were less active and this would largely explain the differences observed in speedagility and cardiorespiratory fitness. Differences in total and abdominal fatness could not be explained by PA, energy intake, diet quality, or FTO rs9939609 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Fitness and fatness levels indicate that urban adolescents from the south are less healthy than those from centralnorthern Europe. Our data suggest that differences in PA might explain differences in important health-related fitness components, yet factors explaining the differences in fatness encountered remain unknown.},

abstract = {We have developed a method for identifying consensus patterns in a set of unaligned DNA sequences known to bind a common protein or to have some other common biochemical function. The method is based on a matrix representation of binding site patterns. Each row of the matrix represents one of the four possible bases, each column represents one of the positions of the binding site and each element is determined by the frequency the indicated base occurs at the indicated position. The goal of the method is to find the most significant matrix--i.e. the one with the lowest probability of occurring by chance--out of all the matrices that can be formed from the set of related sequences. The reliability of the method improves with the number of sequences, while the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. To test this method, we analysed 11 DNA sequences containing promoters regulated by the Escherichia coli LexA protein. The matrices we found were consistent with the known consensus sequence, and could distinguish the generally accepted LexA binding sites from other DNA sequences.},

Hence, to mine useful information from these data is a very important topic. In this paper, we present a software architecture for finding motifs using genetic algorithm (GA). The new approach can find potential motifs in the regions located from the −2000 bp upstream to +1000 bp downstream of transcription start site (TSS). The mutation in the genetic algorithm is performed using position weight matrices to reserve the completely conserved positions. The crossover in the GA is implemented with specially-designed gap penalties to produce an optimal child pattern. We also present a rearrangement method based on position weight matrices to avoid the presence of a very stable local minimum that may be difficult for operators to generate the optimal pattern. The predicted results obtained from our approach are more accurate than that of Gibbs sampler and we spend less computation time than MEME.},

However, identification of these common causal variants and the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations remains a major challenge. Differential transcription factor binding at a SNP resulting in altered gene expression is one possible mechanism. Here we apply PWAS ("proteome-wide analysis of SNPs"), a methodology based on quantitative mass spectrometry that enables rapid screening of SNPs for differential transcription factor binding, to 12 SNPs that are highly associated with type 1 diabetes at the IL2RA locus, encoding the interleukin-2 receptor CD25. We report differential, allele-specific binding of the transcription factors RUNX1, LEF1, CREB, and TFAP4 to IL2RA SNPs rs12722508*A, rs12722522*C, rs41295061*A, and rs2104286*A and demonstrate the functional influence of RUNX1 at rs12722508 by reporter gene assay. Thus, PWAS may be able to contribute to our understanding of the molecular consequences of human genetic variability underpinning susceptibility to multi-factorial disease.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges that modern molecular biology is facing is the understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating gene expression. A fundamental step in this process requires the characterization of regulatory motifs playing key roles in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In particular, transcription is modulated by the interaction of transcription factors with their corresponding binding sites. Weeder Web is a web interface to Weeder, an algorithm for the automatic discovery of conserved motifs in a set of related regulatory DNA sequences. The motifs found are in turn likely to be instances of binding sites for some transcription factor. Other than providing access to the program, the interface has been designed so to make usage of the program itself as simple as possible, and to require very little prior knowledge about the length and the conservation of the motifs to be found. In fact, the interface automatically starts different runs of the program, each one with different parameters, and provides the user with an overall summary of the results as well as some 'advice' on which motifs look more interesting according to their statistical significance and some simple considerations. The web interface is available at the address www.pesolelab.it by following the 'Tools' link.},

abstract = {Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are likely to play an important role in the genetics of complex traits; however, their functional basis remains poorly understood. Using the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines, we combine 1000 Genomes genotypes and an extensive catalogue of human functional elements to investigate the biological mechanisms that eQTLs perturb. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the enrichment of eQTLs in a wide variety of regulatory annotations. We find that approximately 40{\%} of eQTLs occur in open chromatin, and that they are particularly enriched in transcription factor binding sites, suggesting that many directly impact protein-DNA interactions. Analysis of core promoter regions shows that eQTLs also frequently disrupt some known core promoter motifs but, surprisingly, are not enriched in other well-known motifs such as the TATA box. We also show that information from regulatory annotations alone, when weighted by the hierarchical model, can provide a meaningful ranking of the SNPs that are most likely to drive gene expression variation. Our study demonstrates how regulatory annotation and the association signal derived from eQTL-mapping can be combined into a single framework. We used this approach to further our understanding of the biology that drives human gene expression variation, and of the putatively causal SNPs that underlie it.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified loci underlying human diseases, but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4(+) T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and monocytes. We find that ∼90{\%} of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60{\%} mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated RNA upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20{\%} directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.},

A proposal should be concise and must address the question of what you plan to achieve, why you want to and how you are going to do it. In preparing a research proposal, the first thing that you have to do is to decide what it really is that you want to know more about. The questions that you want to research have to be viable as a research project and lead to the creation of new knowledge and understanding. As a general guide research proposals are concise, usually no more than 1500 words in length. A research protocol is a detailed set of activities for the project you propose and these activities are supported by evidence from other research and from your preliminary investigations. It is a valuable practical timetable and guide to your activities and shows some foresight into what you are trying to achieve. It shows above all, evidence of planning, including anticipation of potential problems and how you intend to deal with them. Some tips from the Research Design Service – South West (RDS-SW) on things to consider when writing a proposal/protocol. Is it a good research idea? n the proposal make a convincing and coherent case for the importance of issues to be studied in health, economic and societal terms? n the proposal make a convincing and coherent argument for the need for the research to fill gaps in current knowledge? n the research proposal frame the issues in a way that makes them amenable to research using the methodologies and design proposed? n the research proposed address the key questions in the field? n the aims and objectives of the study clearly described and explained?

abstract = {BACKGROUND Alcohol dependence (AD) is a complex psychiatric disorder and a significant public health problem. Twin and family-based studies have consistently estimated its heritability to be approximately 50{\%}, and many studies have sought to identify specific genetic variants associated with susceptibility to AD. These studies have been primarily linkage or candidate gene based and have been mostly unsuccessful in identifying replicable risk loci. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have improved the detection of specific loci associated with complex traits, including AD. However, findings from GWAS explain only a small proportion of phenotypic variance, and alternative methods have been proposed to investigate the associations that do not meet strict genome-wide significance criteria. METHODS This review summarizes all published AD GWAS and post-GWAS analyses that have sought to exploit GWAS data to identify AD-associated loci. RESULTS Findings from AD GWAS have been largely inconsistent, with the exception of variants encoding the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. Analyses of GWAS data that go beyond standard association testing have demonstrated the polygenic nature of AD and the large contribution of common variants to risk, nominating novel genes and pathways for AD susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS Findings from AD GWAS and post-GWAS analyses have greatly increased our understanding of the genetic etiology of AD. However, it is clear that larger samples will be necessary to detect loci in addition to those that encode alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, which may only be possible through consortium-based efforts. Post-GWAS approaches to studying the genetic influences on AD are increasingly common and could greatly increase our knowledge of both the genetic architecture of AD and the specific genes and pathways that influence risk.},

abstract = {Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and eQTL analyses have produced a large and growing number of genetic associations linked to a wide range of human phenotypes. As of 2013, there were more than 11,000 SNPs associated with a trait as reported in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. However, interpreting the functional roles played by these SNPs remains a challenge. Here we describe an approach that uses the inherent bipartite structure of eQTL networks to place SNPs into a functional context. Using genotyping and gene expression data from 163 lung tissue samples in a study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) we calculated eQTL associations between SNPs and genes and cast significant associations (FDR {\$}{\textless} 0.1{\$}) as links in a bipartite network. To our surprise, we discovered that the highly-connected "hub" SNPs within the network were devoid of disease-associations. However, within the network we identified 35 highly modular communities, which comprise groups of SNPs associated with groups of genes; 13 of these communities were significantly enriched for distinct biological functions (P {\$} {\textless} 5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}) including COPD-related functions. Further, we found that GWAS-significant SNPs were enriched at the cores of these communities, including previously identified GWAS associations for COPD, asthma, and pulmonary function, among others. These results speak to our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other phenotypic traits.},

Through sharing our experiences with a CBPAR project focused on mental health services and supports in several cultural-linguistic immigrant communities in Ontario, Canada, we provide insights into our attempts at establishing reciprocal relationships with community members collaborating in the research study and discuss how these relationships contributed to ethical practice. We examine the successes and challenges with specific attention to issues of power and gain for the researched community. We begin with a discussion of the concept of reciprocity, followed by a description of how it was put into practice in our project, and, finally, conclude with suggestions for how an ethic of reciprocity might contribute to other CBPAR projects.},

abstract = {With the availability of a dense genome-wide map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a central issue in human genetics is whether it is now possible to use linkage disequilibrium (LD) to map genes that cause disease. LD refers to correlations among neighbouring alleles, reflecting 'haplotypes' descended from single, ancestral chromosomes. The size of LD blocks has been the subject of considerable debate. Computer simulations and empirical data have suggested that LD extends only a few kilobases (kb) around common SNPs, whereas other data have suggested that it can extend much further, in some cases greater than 100 kb. It has been difficult to obtain a systematic picture of LD because past studies have been based on only a few (1-3) loci and different populations. Here, we report a large-scale experiment using a uniform protocol to examine 19 randomly selected genomic regions. LD in a United States population of north-European descent typically extends 60 kb from common alleles, implying that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this population. By contrast, LD in a Nigerian population extends markedly less far. The results illuminate human history, suggesting that LD in northern Europeans is shaped by a marked demographic event about 27,000-53,000 years ago},

We identified 11,204 cis and 3,791 trans independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by using linear mixed models to perform genome-wide association analyses. Furthermore, using information on both closely and distantly related individuals, heritability was estimated for all expression traits. Of the set of expressed probes (15,966), 10,580 (66{\%}) had an estimated narrow-sense heritability (h2) greater than zero with a mean (median) value of 0.192 (0.142). Across these probes, on average the proportion of genetic variance explained by all eQTL (hCOJO2) was 31{\%} (0.060/0.192), meaning that 69{\%} is missing, with the sentinel SNP of the largest eQTL explaining 87{\%} (0.052/0.060) of the variance attributed to all identified cis- and trans-eQTL. For the same set of probes, the genetic variance attributed to genome-wide common (MAF {\textgreater} 0.01) HapMap 3 SNPs (hg2) accounted for on average 48{\%} (0.093/0.192) of h2. Taken together, the evidence suggests that approximately half the genetic variance for gene expression is not tagged by common SNPs, and of the variance that is tagged by common SNPs, a large proportion can be attributed to identifiable eQTL of large effect, typically in cis. Finally, we present evidence that, compared with a meta-analysis, using individual-level data results in an increase of approximately 50{\%} in power to detect eQTL.},

abstract = {Motivation: The ability to identify complex motifs, i.e. non-contiguous nucleotide sequences, is a key feature of modern motif finders. Addressing this problem is extremely important, not only because these motifs can accurately model biological phenomena but because its extraction is highly dependent upon the appropriate selection of numerous search parameters. Currently available combinatorial algorithms have proved to be highly efficient in exhaustively enumer-ating motifs (including complex motifs), which fulfill certain extraction criteria. However, one major problem with these methods is the large number of parameters that need to be specified. Results: We propose a new algorithm, MUSA (Motif finding using an UnSupervised Approach), that can be used either to autonomously find over-represented complex motifs or to estimate search para-meters for modern motif finders. This method relies on a biclustering algorithm that operates on a matrix of co-occurrences of small motifs. The performance of this method is independent of the composite structure of the motifs being sought, making few assumptions about their characteristics. The MUSA algorithm was applied to two datasets involving the bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The first one was composed of 70 s 54 -dependent promoter sequences and the second dataset included 54 promoter sequences of up-regulated genes in response to phenol, as suggested by quantitative proteomics. The results obtained indicate that this approach is very effective at identifying complex motifs of biological significance. Availability: The MUSA algorithm is available upon request from the authors, and will be made available via a Web based interface.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Binding of transcription factors to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is key to the mediation of transcriptional regulation. Information on experimentally validated functional TFBSs is limited and consequently there is a need for accurate prediction of TFBSs for gene annotation and in applications such as evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing disease. TFBSs are generally recognized by scanning a position weight matrix (PWM) against DNA using one of a number of available computer programs. Thus we set out to evaluate the best tools that can be used locally (and are therefore suitable for large-scale analyses) for creating PWMs from high-throughput ChIP-Seq data and for scanning them against DNA. RESULTS We evaluated a set of de novo motif discovery tools that could be downloaded and installed locally using ENCODE-ChIP-Seq data and showed that rGADEM was the best-performing tool. TFBS prediction tools used to scan PWMs against DNA fall into two classes - those that predict individual TFBSs and those that identify clusters. Our evaluation showed that FIMO and MCAST performed best respectively. CONCLUSIONS Selection of the best-performing tools for generating PWMs from ChIP-Seq data and for scanning PWMs against DNA has the potential to improve prediction of precise transcription factor binding sites within regions identified by ChIP-Seq experiments for gene finding, understanding regulation and in evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing disease.},

abstract = {This report is a step-by-step guide to the practical application of economic evaluation within the social welfare field. It is the second volume of a report resulting from a two-year project to promote better understanding and use of economic evaluation in the social welfare field. Volume I (Sefton et al., 2002) focuses on the application of economic approaches to a social welfare context, while this report provides more detailed technical advice on how some of these approaches might be applied in practice. In addition, it discusses some of the issues to be considered and choices to be made when undertaking an economic evaluation in practice. Inevitably, there is some overlap between the two volumes to enable each to stand alone and to keep cross-referencing to a minimum. Readers are referred to Volume I, however, where more detailed information that is not central to the understanding of this report is available. This report is aimed primarily at noneconomists involved in the evaluation of social welfare programmes, but also at economists who may be unfamiliar with the social welfare field. It is intended to provide a greater understanding of the methods of economic evaluation and the practical processes involved. It should not be seen as an attempt to provide either an exhaustive or definitive guide to economic evaluation, since this is a broad and complex area. Instead, the report aims to provide the reader with an understanding of the basic building blocks involved and enough knowledge to put into place the beginnings of a successful economic evaluation. Throughout the report, references to further literature are provided for those readers who wish to explore any area of economic evaluation in more detail and readers are advised to consult with economists before attempting a full economic evaluation alone.},

We show that these variants are concentrated in regulatory DNA marked by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.},

abstract = {Large experimental efforts are characterizing the regulatory genome, yet we are still missing a systematic definition of functional and silent genetic variants in non-coding regions. Here, we integrated DNaseI footprinting data with sequence-based transcription factor (TF) motif models to predict the impact of a genetic variant on TF binding across 153 tissues and 1,372 TF motifs. Each annotation we derived is specific for a cell-type condition or assay and is locally motif-driven. We found 5.8 million genetic variants in footprints, 66{\%} of which are predicted by our model to affect TF binding. Comprehensive examination using allele-specific hypersensitivity (ASH) reveals that only the latter group consistently shows evidence for ASH (3,217 SNPs at 20{\%} FDR), suggesting that most (97{\%}) genetic variants in footprinted regulatory regions are indeed silent. Combining this information with GWAS data reveals that our annotation helps in computationally fine-mapping 86 SNPs in GWAS hit regions with at least a 2-fold increase in the posterior odds of picking the causal SNP. The rich meta information provided by the tissue-specificity and the identity of the putative TF binding site being affected also helps in identifying the underlying mechanism supporting the association. As an example, the enrichment for LDL level-associated SNPs is 9.1-fold higher among SNPs predicted to affect HNF4 binding sites than in a background model already including tissue-specific annotation.},

abstract = {The rejection of reliability and validity in qualitative inquiry in the 1980s has resulted in an interesting shift for "ensuring rigor" from the investigator's actions during the course of the research, to the reader or consumer of qualitative inquiry. The emphasis on strategies that are implemented during the research process has been replaced by strategies for evaluating trustworthiness and utility that are implemented once a study is completed. In this article, we argue that reliability and validity remain appropriate concepts for attaining rigor in qualitative research. We argue that qualitative researchers should reclaim responsibility for reliability and validity by implementing verification strategies integral and self-correcting during the conduct of inquiry itself. This ensures the attainment of rigor using strategies inherent within each qualitative design, and moves the responsibility for incorporating and maintaining reliability and validity from external reviewers' judgements to the investigators themselves. Finally, we make a plea for a return to terminology for ensuring rigor that is used by mainstream science.},

abstract = {AIMS: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex multifactorial disorder with more than 40 loci associated with disease susceptibility. Most of these genome-wide significant loci reside in noncoding regions, it is important to decipher the potential regulatory function of these variants and to differentiate between true and tag signals. Nowadays, databases are being developed to study and predict the function of these associated variants, and RegulomeDB is one such database. METHODS: We used RegulomeDB to analyze the potential function of the associated variants reported in five genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T2D. RESULTS: We investigated the 1,567 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 989 SNPs with a score of 1-6. Of those 989 SNPs, only 64 returned with RegulomeDB score {\textless}3 (evidence of regulatory function), and only four of these were GWAS significant SNPs (THADA/rs10203174, score = 1b; UBE2E2/rs7612463, score = 2a; ARAP1/rs1552224 and TP53INP1/rs8996852, score = 2b). But only 63 {\%} of the annotated SNPs showed regulatory function that is an important limitation of the RegulomeDB as this database only provides information of few regulatory elements. CONCLUSION: This study further supports that some of the noncoding GWAS variants are the true associations and not the tag ones. This study also proves the utility and importance of the RegulomeDB and other such databases. Although it is an extensive database of regulatory elements but has certain limitation due to utilization of only few types of regulatory elements and pathways.},

abstract = {Oligomers of length k, or k-mers, are convenient and widely used features for modeling the properties and functions of DNA and protein sequences. However, k-mers suffer from the inherent limitation that if the parameter k is increased to resolve longer features, the probability of observing any specific k-mer becomes very small, and k-mer counts approach a binary variable, with most k-mers absent and a few present once. Thus, any statistical learning approach using k-mers as features becomes susceptible to noisy training set k-mer frequencies once k becomes large. To address this problem, we introduce alternative feature sets using gapped k-mers, a new classifier, gkm-SVM, and a general method for robust estimation of k-mer frequencies. To make the method applicable to large-scale genome wide applications, we develop an efficient tree data structure for computing the kernel matrix. We show that compared to our original kmer-SVM and alternative approaches, our gkm-SVM predicts functional genomic regulatory elements and tissue specific enhancers with significantly improved accuracy, increasing the precision by up to a factor of two. We then show that gkm-SVM consistently outperforms kmer-SVM on human ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, and further demonstrate the general utility of our method using a Nave-Bayes classifier. Although developed for regulatory sequence analysis, these methods can be applied to any sequence classification problem.},

abstract = {—Motif discovery in sequence data is fundamental to many biological problems such as antibody biomarker iden-tification. Recent advances in instrumental techniques make it possible to generate thousands of protein sequences at once, which raises a big data issue for the existing motif finding algorithms: They either work only in a small scale of several hundred sequences or have to trade accuracy for efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that by intelligently clustering sequences, it is possible to significantly improve the scalability of all the existing motif finding algorithms without losing accuracy at all. An anchor based sequence clustering algorithm (ASC) is thus proposed to divide a sequence dataset into multiple smaller clusters so that sequences sharing the same motif will be located into the same cluster. Then an existing motif finding algorithm can be applied to each individual cluster to generate motifs. In the end, the results from multiple clusters are merged together as final output. Experimental results show that our approach is generic and orders of magnitude faster than traditional motif finding algorithms. It can discover motifs from protein sequences in the scale that no existing algorithm can handle. In particular, ASC reduces the running time of a very popular motif finding algorithm, MEME, from weeks to a few minutes with even better accuracy.},

abstract = {Gene expression is controlled primarily by transcription factors, whose DNA binding sites are typically 10 nt long. We develop a population-genetic model to understand how the length and information content of such binding sites evolve. Our analysis is based on an inherent trade-off between specificity, which is greater in long binding sites, and robustness to mutation, which is greater in short binding sites. The evolutionary stable distribution of binding site lengths predicted by the model agrees with the empirical distribution (5-31 nt, with mean 9.9 nt for eukaryotes), and it is remarkably robust to variation in the underlying parameters of population size, mutation rate, number of transcription factor targets, and strength of selection for proper binding and selection against improper binding. In a systematic data set of eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcription factors we also uncover strong relationships between the length of a binding site and its information content per nucleotide, as well as between the number of targets a transcription factor regulates and the information content in its binding sites. Our analysis explains these features as well as the remarkable conservation of binding site characteristics across diverse taxa.},

To identify new factors, which may contribute to AD, different approaches are taken including proteomics, genetics, and functional genomics. Here, we used a bioinformatics approach and found that distinct AD-related genes share modules of transcription factor binding sites, suggesting a transcriptional coregulation. To detect additional coregulated genes, which may potentially contribute to AD, we established a new bioinformatics workflow with known multivariate methods like support vector machines, biclustering, and predicted transcription factor binding site modules by using in silico analysis and over 400 expression arrays from human and mouse. Two significant modules are composed of three transcription factor families: CTCF, SP1F, and EGRF/ZBPF, which are conserved between human and mouse APP promoter sequences. The specific combination of in silico promoter and multivariate analysis can identify regulation mechanisms of genes involved in multifactorial diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In recent years, advances in genomic and computational tools have led to a wealth of methods for such analy- sis at the sequence, expression, pathway, module, and entire network level. Here, we review computational methods developed to study transcriptional regulatory networks using comparative genomics, from sequence to func- tional data. We highlight how these methods use evolutionary conservation and divergence to reliably detect regulatory components as well as estimate the extent and rate of divergence. Finally, we discuss the promise and open challenges in linking regulatory divergence to phenotypic divergence and adaptation. 399},

Results: We present MITSU (Motif discovery by ITerative Sampling and Updating), a novel algorithm for motif discovery, which combines sEM with an improved approximation to the likelihood function, which is unconstrained with regard to the distribution of motif occurrences within the input dataset. The algorithm is evaluated quantitatively on realistic synthetic data and several collections of characterized pro-karyotic TFBS motifs and shown to outperform EM and an alternative sEM-based algorithm, particularly in terms of site-level positive pre-dictive value.

Many motif discovery methods do not scale well to large datasets. Another issue is identifying discriminative rather than generative motifs. Such discriminative motifs are important for identifying co-factors and for explaining changes in behavior between different conditions. Results: To address these issues we developed a method for DECOnvolved Discriminative motif discovery (DECOD). DECOD uses a k-mer count table and so its running time is independent of the size of the input set. By deconvolving the k-mers DECOD considers context information without using the sequences directly. DECOD outperforms previous methods both in speed and in accuracy when using simulated and real biological benchmark data. We performed new binding experiments for p53 mutants and used DECOD to identify p53 co-factors, suggesting new mechanisms for p53 activation.

For this 2016 release, we expanded the JASPAR CORE collection with 494 new TF binding profiles (315 in vertebrates, 11 in nematodes, 3 in insects, 1 in fungi and 164 in plants) and updated 59 profiles (58 in vertebrates and 1 in fungi). The introduced profiles represent an 83{\%} expansion and 10{\%} update when compared to the previous release. We updated the structural annotation of the TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) following a published hierarchical structural classification. In addition, we introduced 130 transcription factor flexible models trained on ChIP-seq data for vertebrates, which capture dinucleotide dependencies within TF binding sites. This new JASPAR release is accompanied by a new web tool to infer JASPAR TF binding profiles recognized by a given TF protein sequence. Moreover, we provide the users with a Ruby module complementing the JASPAR API to ease programmatic access and use of the JASPAR collection of profiles. Finally, we provide the JASPAR2016 R/Bioconductor data package with the data of this release.},

Mobile health strategies could address this gap but lack evidence of therapeutic benefit.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a lifestyle-focused semipersonalized support program delivered by mobile phone text message on cardiovascular risk factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN AND SETTING: The Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME) trial was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial that recruited 710 patients (mean age, 58 [SD, 9.2] years; 82{\%} men; 53{\%} current smokers) with proven coronary heart disease (prior myocardial infarction or proven angiographically) between September 2011 and November 2013 from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTIONS: Patients in the intervention group (n = 352) received 4 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Text messages provided advice, motivational reminders, and support to change lifestyle behaviors. Patients in the control group (n=358) received usual care. Messages for each participant were selected from a bank of messages according to baseline characteristics (eg, smoking) and delivered via an automated computerized message management system. The program was not interactive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at 6 months. Secondary end points included systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and smoking status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At 6 months, levels of LDL-C were significantly lower in intervention participants, with concurrent reductions in systolic blood pressure and BMI, significant increases in physical activity, and a significant reduction in smoking.

abstract = {Most complex trait-associated variants are located in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome, where they have been shown to disrupt transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding motifs. Variable TF-DNA interactions are therefore increasingly considered as key drivers of phenotypic variation. However, recent genome-wide studies revealed that the majority of variable TF-DNA binding events are not driven by sequence alterations in the motif of the studied TF. This observation implies that the molecular mechanisms underlying TF-DNA binding variation and, by extrapolation, inter-individual phenotypic variation are more complex than originally anticipated. Here, we summarize the findings that led to this important paradigm shift and review proposed mechanisms for local, proximal, or distal genetic variation-driven variable TF-DNA binding. In addition, we discuss the biomedical implications of these findings for our ability to dissect the molecular role(s) of non-coding genetic variants in complex traits, including disease susceptibility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stretch enhancers (SEs) are large chromatin-defined regulatory elements that are at least 3,000 base pairs (bps) long, in contrast to the median enhancer length of 800 bps. SEs tend to be cell-type specific, regulate cell-type specific gene expression, and are enriched in disease-associated genetic variants in disease-relevant cell types. Transcription factors (TFs) can bind to enhancers to modulate enhancer activity, and their sequence specificity can be represented by motifs. We hypothesize motifs can provide a biological context for how genetic variants contribute to disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We integrated chromatin state, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility [measured as DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHSs)] maps across nine different cell types. Motif enrichment analyses of chromatin-defined enhancer sequences identify several known cell-type specific "master" factors. Furthermore, de novo motif discovery not only recovers many of these motifs, but also identifies novel non-canonical motifs, providing additional insight into TF binding preferences. Across the length of SEs, motifs are most enriched in DHSs, though relative enrichment is also observed outside of DHSs. Interestingly, we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with diseases or quantitative traits significantly overlap motif occurrences located in SEs, but outside of DHSs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the role of SEs in influencing risk for diseases and suggest an expanded regulatory functional role for motifs that occur outside highly accessible chromatin. Furthermore, the motif signatures generated here expand our understanding of the binding preference of well-characterized TFs.},

abstract = {Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-specific colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

abstract = {SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date. GWASs in human populations have discovered hundreds of SNPs significantly associated with complex traits 1,2 , yet for any one trait they typically account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation. Where is the missing heritability, the so-called dark matter of the genome 3,4 ? Suggested explanations include the existence of gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions 5 , the common disease–rare variant hypothesis 6 and the possibility that inherited epigenetic factors cause resemblance between relatives 7,8 . However, the variance explained by the validated SNPs is usually much less than the narrow-sense heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic variance. Non-additive genetic effects do not contribute to the narrow-sense heritability, so explanations based on non-additive effects are not relevant to the problem of missing herit-ability (Supplementary Note). There are two logical explanations for the failure of validated SNP associations to explain the estimated heritability: either the causal variants each explain such a small amount of variation that their effects do not reach stringent significance thresholds and/or the causal variants are not in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the SNPs that have been genotyped. Lack of complete LD might, for instance, occur if causal variants have lower minor allele frequency (MAF) than genotyped SNPs. Here we test these two hypotheses and estimate the contribution of each to the heritability of height in humans as a model complex trait. Height in humans is a classical quantitative trait, easy to measure and studied for well over a century as a model for investigating the genetic basis of complex traits 9,10 . The heritability of height has been estimated to be {\~{}}0.8 (refs. 9,11–13). Rare mutations that cause extreme short or tall stature have been found 14,15 , but these do not explain much of the variation in the general population. Recent GWASs on tens of thousands of individuals have detected {\~{}}50 variants that are associated with height in the population, but these in total account for only {\~{}}5{\%} of phenotypic variance 16–19 . Data from a GWAS that are collected to detect statistical associations between SNPs and complex traits are usually analyzed by testing each SNP individually for an association with the trait. To account for the large number of significance tests carried out, a very stringent P value is used. This reduces the occurrence of false positives, but it may cause many real associations to be missed, especially if individual SNPs have a small effect on the trait. An alternative approach designed to overcome this problem is to fit all the SNPs simultaneously 20 . The effects of the SNPs are treated statistically as random, and the variance explained by all the SNPs together is estimated. This approach, which we use here, does not attempt to test the significance of individual SNPs but provides an unbiased estimate of the variance explained by the SNPs in total.},

abstract = {Neutrophils form the most abundant leukocyte subset and are central to many disease processes. Technical challenges in transcriptomic profiling have prohibited genomic approaches to date. Here we map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in peripheral blood CD16+ neutrophils from 101 healthy European adults. We identify cis-eQTL for 3281 neutrophil-expressed genes including many implicated in neutrophil function, with 450 of these not previously observed in myeloid or lymphoid cells. Paired comparison with monocyte eQTL demonstrates nuanced conditioning of genetic regulation of gene expression by cellular context, which relates to cell-type-specific DNA methylation and histone modifications. Neutrophil eQTL are markedly enriched for trait-associated variants particularly autoimmune, allergy and infectious disease. We further demonstrate how eQTL in PADI4 and NOD2 delineate risk variant function in rheumatoid arthritis, leprosy and Crohn's disease. Taken together, these data help advance understanding of the genetics of gene expression, neutrophil biology and immune-related diseases.},

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the “missing heritability” problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

Over the past decades, many attempts using consensus and probability training model for motif finding are successful.

To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, we propose an entropy-based position projection algorithm, called EPP, which designs a projection process to divide the dataset and explores the best local optimal solution. The experimental results on real DNA sequences, Tompa data, and ChIP-seq data show that EPP is advantageous in dealing with the motif discovery problem and outperforms current widely used algorithms.},

abstract = {Motivation and Results: The position weight matrix (PWM) is a pop-ular method to model transcription factor binding sites. A fundamental problem in cis-regulatory analysis is to ''count'' the occurrences of a PWM in a DNA sequence. We propose a novel probabilistic score to solve this problem of counting PWM occurrences. The proposed score has two important properties: (1) It gives appropriate weights to both strong and weak occurrences of the PWM, without using thresholds. (2) For any given PWM, this score can be computed while allowing for occurrences of other, a priori known PWMs, in a statistically sound framework. Additionally, the score is efficiently differentiable with respect to the PWM parameters, which has important conse-quences for designing search algorithms. The second problem we address is to find, ab initio, PWMs that have high counts in one set of sequences, and low counts in another. We develop a novel algorithm to solve this ''discriminative motif-finding problem'', using the proposed score for counting a PWM in the sequences. The algorithm is a local search technique that exploits derivative information on an objective function to enhance speed and performance. It is extensively tested on synthetic data, and shown to perform better than other discriminative as well as non-discriminative PWM finding algorithms. It is then applied to cis-regulatory modules involved in development of the fruitfly embryo, to elicit known and novel motifs. We finally use the algorithm on genes predictive of social behavior in the honey bee, and find interesting motifs.},

abstract = {Important knowledge about the determinants of complex human phenotypes can be obtained from the estimation of heritability, the fraction of phenotypic variation in a population that is determined by genetic factors. Here, we make use of extensive phenotype data in Iceland, long-range phased genotypes, and a population-wide genealogical database to examine the heritability of 11 quantitative and 12 dichotomous phenotypes in a sample of 38,167 individuals. Most previous estimates of heritability are derived from family-based approaches such as twin studies, which may be biased upwards by epistatic interactions or shared environment. Our estimates of heritability, based on both closely and distantly related pairs of individuals, are significantly lower than those from previous studies. We examine phenotypic correlations across a range of relationships, from siblings to first cousins, and find that the excess phenotypic correlation in these related individuals is predominantly due to shared environment as opposed to dominance or epistasis. We also develop a new method to jointly estimate narrow-sense heritability and the heritability explained by genotyped SNPs. Unlike existing methods, this approach permits the use of information from both closely and distantly related pairs of individuals, thereby reducing the variance of estimates of heritability explained by genotyped SNPs while preventing upward bias. Our results show that common SNPs explain a larger proportion of the heritability than previously thought, with SNPs present on Illumina 300K genotyping arrays explaining more than half of the heritability for the 23 phenotypes examined in this study. Much of the remaining heritability is likely to be due to rare alleles that are not captured by standard genotyping arrays.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years many genetic variants (eSNPs) have been reported as associated with expression of transcripts in trans. However, the causal variants and regulatory mechanisms through which they act remain mostly unknown. In this paper we follow two kinds of usual suspects: SNPs that alter coding regions or transcription factors, identifiable by sequencing data with transcriptional profiles in the same cohort. We show these interpretable genomic regions are enriched for eSNP association signals, thereby naturally defining source-target gene pairs. We map these pairs onto a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and study their topological properties. RESULTS For exonic eSNP sources, we report source-target proximity and high target degree within the PPI network. These pairs are more likely to be co-expressed and the eSNPs tend to have a cis effect, modulating the expression of the source gene. In contrast, transcription factor source-target pairs are not observed to have such properties, but instead a transcription factor source tends to assemble into units of defined functional roles along with its gene targets, and to share with them the same functional cluster of the PPI network. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest two modes of trans regulation: transcription factor variation frequently acts via a modular regulation mechanism, with multiple targets that share a function with the transcription factor source. Notwithstanding, exon variation often acts by a local cis effect, delineating shorter paths of interacting proteins across functional clusters of the PPI network.},

Since microarrays provided our first window into global cellular state, computational biologists have eagerly attacked the problem of mapping TF networks, a key part of the cell's control circuitry. In retrospect, however, steady-state mRNA abundance levels were a poor substitute for TF activity levels and gene transcription rates. Likewise, mapping TF binding through chromatin immunoprecipitation proved less predictive of functional regulation and less amenable to systematic elucidation of complete networks than originally hoped.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Planted (l, d)-motif identification is an important and challenging problem in computa-tional biology. In this paper, we present an original algorithm (GARPS) that combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Projection Strategy (RPS) to identify (l, d)-motifs. We start with RPS to find good starting positions by introducing position-weighted function and hash each of all l-mers in the input sequences onto the corresponding k-dimensional (k {\textless} l) subspace so as to deduce a set of candidate motifs. Then, we use the candidate mo-tifs as the initial population of genetic algorithm to make series of iterations to refine motif candidates. Experimental results on simulated data show that GARPS performs better than the Projection algorithm and improves finding faint motifs. We also present experimental results on realistic biological data by identifying CRP binding sites in Escherichia Coli as well as PDR3 binding sites in the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Furthermore, the imple-mented random projection algorithm RPS can be fine tuned for optimizing many heuristics methods starting from random seeds, such as simulated annealing, Gibbs sampling.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genes and genetic variants (mainly SNPs) that contribute to complex diseases in humans. Functional characterization and mechanistic elucidation of these SNPs and genes action are the next major challenge. It has been well established that SNPs altering the amino acids of protein-coding genes can drastically impact protein function, and play an important role in molecular pathogenesis. Functions of regulatory SNPs can be complex and elusive, and involve gene expression regulation through the effect on RNA splicing, transcription factor binding, DNA methylation and miRNA recruitment. In the present review, we summarize the recent progress in our understanding of functional consequences of GWAS-associated non-coding regulatory SNPs, and discuss the application of systems genetics and network biology in the interpretation of GWAS findings.},

abstract = {Correct annotation of the genetic relationships between samples is essential for population genomic studies, which could be biased by errors or omissions. To this end, we used identity-by-state (IBS) and identity-by-descent (IBD) methods to assess genetic relatedness of individuals within HapMap phase III data. We analyzed data from 1,397 individuals across 11 ethnic populations. Our results support previous studies (Pemberton et al., 2010; Kyriazopoulou-Panagiotopoulou et al., 2011) assessing unknown relatedness present within this population. Additionally, we present evidence for 1,657 novel pairwise relationships across 9 populations. Surprisingly, significant Cotterman's coefficients of relatedness K1 (IBD1) values were detected between pairs of known parents. Furthermore, significant K2 (IBD2) values were detected in 32 previously annotated parent-child relationships. Consistent with a hypothesis of inbreeding, regions of homozygosity (ROH) were identified in the offspring of related parents, of which a subset overlapped those reported in previous studies (Gibson et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2011). In total, we inferred 28 inbred individuals with ROH that overlapped areas of relatedness between the parents and/or IBD2 sharing at a different genomic locus between a child and a parent. Finally, 8 previously annotated parent-child relationships had unexpected K0 (IBD0) values (resulting from a chromosomal abnormality or genotype error), and 10 previously annotated second-degree relationships along with 38 other novel pairwise relationships had unexpected IBD2 (indicating two separate paths of recent ancestry). These newly described types of relatedness may impact the outcome of previous studies and should inform the design of future studies relying on the HapMap Phase III resource.},

We identified 36 loci with multiple associated variants for height (38 leading and 49 additional SNPs, 87 in total) via a genome-wide SNP selection procedure. The 49 new SNPs explain approximately 1.3{\%} of variance, nearly doubling the heritability explained at the 36 loci. We did not find any locus showing multiple associated SNPs for BMI.

abstract = {Motivation: Transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq datasets have particular characteristics that provide unique challenges and opportunities for motif discovery. Most existing motif discovery algorithms do not scale well to such large datasets, or fail to report many motifs associated with cofactors of the ChIP-ed TF. Results: We present DREME, a motif discovery algorithm specifically designed to find the short, core DNA-binding motifs of eukaryotic TFs, and optimized to analyze very large ChIP-seq datasets in minutes. Using DREME, we discover the binding motifs of the the ChIP-ed TF and many cofactors in mouse ES cell (mESC), mouse erythrocyte and human cell line ChIP-seq datasets. For example, in mESC ChIP-seq data for the TF Esrrb, we discover the binding motifs for eight cofactor TFs important in the maintenance of pluripotency. Several other commonly used algorithms find at most two cofactor motifs in this same dataset. DREME can also perform discriminative motif discovery, and we use this feature to provide evidence that Sox2 and Oct4 do not bind in mES cells as an obligate heterodimer. DREME is much faster than many commonly used algorithms, scales linearly in dataset size, finds multiple, non-redundant motifs and reports a reliable measure of statistical significance for each motif found. DREME is available as part of the MEME Suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools (http://meme.nbcr.net).},

The study was a seven weeks dietary weight loss intervention with Brazilian adult obese women (n = 109). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated and polymorphisms in these genes were assessed by real-time PCR assays. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (2 × 2) were used to analyze the intervention effect between polymorphisms and BMI over the period and after stratification for age and socioeconomic status (SES). The weight loss intervention resulted in decreased BMI over the seven-week period (p {\textless} 0.001), for high and low SES (p {\textless} 0.05) and mainly for participants with 30-49 y. The intervention did not result in a statistically significant difference in weight loss between polymorphism carriers and non-carriers, and although, the ADRB2, ADRB3 and GHRL polymorphisms did not moderate weight loss, the Gln27Glu polymorphism carriers showed a lower BMI compared to non-carriers in the low SES (p = 0.018) and the 30-39 y (p = 0.036) groups, suggesting a role for this polymorphism related to BMI control.},

Although much emphasis has been placed on changes in transcriptional regulation, gene expression is regulated at many levels, all of which must ultimately be studied together to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of gene expression. Here we compare the evolution of transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation that is mediated by microRNAs, a large class of small, non-coding RNAs in plants and animals, focusing on the evolution of the individual regulators and their binding sites. As an initial step towards integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, we propose a simple model that describes the transcriptional regulation of new microRNA genes.},

abstract = {The mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has emerged as an important tool for linking genetic variation to changes in gene regulation. However, it remains difficult to identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels are also available. We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each individual. We identified 8,902 locations at which the DNase-seq read depth correlated significantly with genotype at a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion (false discovery rate = 10{\%}). We call such variants 'DNase I sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription factor binding sites and are frequently associated with allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A substantial fraction (16{\%}) of dsQTLs are also associated with variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is, these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we estimate that as many as 55{\%} of eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation.},

We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium (LD) between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency (MAF) than the SNPs explored to date.},

abstract = {The core promoter of eukaryotic genes is the minimal DNA region that recruits the basal transcription machinery to direct efficient and accurate transcription initiation. The fraction of human and yeast genes that contain specific core promoter elements such as the TATA box and the initiator (INR) remains unclear and core promoter motifs specific for TATA-less genes remain to be identified. Here, we present genome-scale computational analyses indicating that ∼76{\%} of human core promoters lack TATA-like elements, have a high GC content, and are enriched in Sp1 binding sites. We further identify two motifs -M3 (SCGGAAGY) and M22 (TGCGCANK) -that occur preferentially in human TATA-less core promoters. About 24{\%} of human genes have a TATA-like element and their promoters are generally AT-rich; however, only ∼10{\%} of these TATA-containing promoters have the canonical TATA box (TATAWAWR). In contrast, ∼46{\%} of human core promoters contain the consensus INR (YYANWYY) and ∼30{\%} are INR-containing TATA-less genes. Significantly, ∼46{\%} of human promoters lack both TATA-like and consensus INR elements. Surprisingly, mammalian-type INR sequences are present -and tend to cluster -in the transcription start site (TSS) region of ∼40{\%} of yeast core promoters and the frequency of specific core promoter types appears to be conserved in yeast and human genomes. Gene Ontology analyses reveal that TATA-less genes in humans, as in yeast, are frequently involved in basic " housekeeping " processes, while TATA-containing genes are more often highly regulated, such as by biotic or stress stimuli.

abstract = {BACKGROUND CpG islands are important regions in DNA. They usually appear at the 5' end of genes containing GC-rich dinucleotides. When DNA methylation occurs, gene regulation is affected and it sometimes leads to carcinogenesis. We propose a new detection program using a hidden-markov model alongside the Viterbi algorithm. METHODS Our solution provides a graphical user interface not seen in many of the other CGI detection programs and we unify the detection and analysis under one program to allow researchers to scan a genetic sequence, detect the significant CGIs, and analyze the sequence once the scan is complete for any noteworthy findings. RESULTS Using human chromosome 21, we show that our algorithm finds a significant number of CGIs. Running an analysis on a dataset of promoters discovered that the characteristics of methylated and unmethylated CGIs are significantly different. Finally, we detected significantly different motifs between methylated and unmethylated CGI promoters using MEME and MAST. CONCLUSIONS Developing this new tool for the community using powerful algorithms has shown that combining analysis with CGI detection will improve the continued research within the field of epigenetics.},

abstract = {Bayesian multiple-regression methods are being successfully used for genomic prediction and selection. These regression models simultaneously fit many more markers than the number of observations available for the analysis. Thus, the Bayes theorem is used to combine prior beliefs of marker effects, which are expressed in terms of prior distributions, with information from data for inference. Often, the analyses are too complex for closed-form solutions and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is used to draw inferences from posterior distributions. This chapter describes how these Bayesian multiple-regression analyses can be used for GWAS. In most GWAS, false positives are controlled by limiting the genome-wise error rate, which is the probability of one or more false-positive results, to a small value. As the number of test in GWAS is very large, this results in very low power. Here we show how in Bayesian GWAS false positives can be controlled by limiting the proportion of false-positive results among all positives to some small value. The advantage of this approach is that the power of detecting associations is not inversely related to the number of markers.},

Using variants from five phenotypes, we describe a data-driven approach to determine the tissue and cell types most relevant to a trait of interest and to identify the subset of regulatory features likely impacted by these variants. Last, we experimentally evaluate six predicted functional variants at six lipid-associated loci and demonstrate significant evidence for allele-specific impact on expression levels. GREGOR systematically evaluates enrichment of genetic variation with the vast collection of regulatory data available to explore novel biological mechanisms of disease and guide us toward the functional variant at trait-associated loci.

All these algorithms are efficient, because in each case their time requirement grows as a polynomial function (such as n, n 2 , or n 3) of the size of the input. To better appreciate such efficient algorithms, consider the alternative: In all these prob-lems we are searching for a solution (path, tree, matching, etc.) from among an exponential population of possibilities. Indeed, n boys can be matched with n girls in n! different ways, a graph with n vertices has n n−2 spanning trees, and a typical graph has an exponential num-ber of paths from s to t. All these problems could in principle be solved in exponential time by checking through all candidate solutions, one by one. But an algorithm whose running time is 2 n , or worse, is all but useless in practice (see the next box). The quest for efficient algorithms is about finding clever ways to bypass this process of exhaustive search, using clues from the input in order to dramatically narrow down the search space.},

However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

abstract = {The DNA motif discovery problem abstracts the task of discovering short, conserved sites in genomic DNA. Pevzner and Sze recently described a precise combinatorial formulation of motif discovery that motivates the following algorithmic challenge: nd twenty planted occurrences of a motif of length fteen in roughly twelve kilobases of genomic sequence, where each occurrence of the motif differs from its consensus in four randomly chosen positions. Such " subtle " motifs, though statistically highly signi cant, expose a weakness in existing motif-nding algorithms, which typically fail to discover them. Pevzner and Sze introduced new algorithms to solve their (15,4)-motif challenge, but these methods do not scale ef ciently to more dif cult problems in the same family, such as the (14,4)-, (16,5)-, and (18,6)-motif problems. We introduce a novel motif-discovery algorithm, PROJECTION, de-signed to enhance the performance of existing motif nders using random projections of the input's substrings. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that PROJECTION reme-dies the weakness observed in existing algorithms, typically solving the dif cult (14,4)-, (16,5)-, and (18,6)-motif problems. Our algorithm is robust to nonuniform background se-quence distributions and scales to larger amounts of sequence than that speci ed in the original challenge. A probabilistic estimate suggests that related motif-nding problems that PROJECTION fails to solve are in all likelihood inherently intractable. We also test the performance of our algorithm on realistic biological examples, including transcription factor binding sites in eukaryotes and ribosome binding sites in prokaryotes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Genome-wide surveys have detected cis-acting quantitative trait loci altering levels of RNA transcripts (RNA-eQTLs) by associating SNV alleles to transcript levels. However, the sensitivity and specificity of detection of cis- expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) by genetic approaches, reliant as it is on measurements of transcript levels in recombinant inbred strains or offspring from arranged crosses, is unknown, as is their relationship to QTL's for complex phenotypes. RESULTS We used transcriptome-wide differential allele expression (DAE) to detect cis-eQTLs in forebrain and kidney from reciprocal crosses between three mouse inbred strains, 129S1/SvlmJ, DBA/2J, and CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6 J. Two of these crosses were previously characterized for cis-eQTLs and QTLs for various complex phenotypes by genetic analysis of recombinant inbred (RI) strains. 5.4 {\%}, 1.9 {\%} and 1.5 {\%} of genes assayed in forebrain of B6/129SF1, B6/DBAF1, and B6/CASTF1 mice, respectively, showed differential allelic expression, indicative of cis-acting alleles at these genes. Moreover, the majority of DAE QTLs were observed to be tissue-specific with only a small fraction showing cis-effects in both tissues. Comparing DAE QTLs in F1 mice to cis-eQTLs previously mapped in RI strains we observed that many of the cis-eQTLs were not confirmed by DAE. Additionally several novel DAE-QTLs not identified as cis-eQTLs were identified suggesting that there are differences in sensitivity and specificity for QTL detection between the two methodologies. Strain specific DAE QTLs in B6/DBAF1 mice were located in excess at candidate genes for alcohol use disorders, seizures, and angiogenesis previously implicated by genetic linkage in C57BL/6J × DBA/2JF2 mice or BXD RI strains. CONCLUSIONS Via a survey for differential allele expression in F1 mice, a substantial proportion of genes were found to have alleles altering expression in cis-acting fashion. Comparing forebrain and kidney, many or most of these alleles were tissue-specific in action. The identification of strain specific DAE QTLs, can assist in assessment of candidate genes located within the large intervals associated with trait QTLs.},

abstract = {Plants are fascinating and complex organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the organization, function and evolution of plant genes is essential to disentangle important biological processes and to advance crop engineering and breeding strategies. The ultimate aim in deciphering complex biological processes is the discovery of causal genes and regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes. The recent surge of omics data has opened the door to a system-wide understanding of the flow of biological information underlying complex traits. However, dealing with the corresponding large data sets represents a challenging endeavor that calls for the development of powerful bioinformatics methods. A popular approach is the construction and analysis of gene networks. Such networks are often used for genome-wide representation of the complex functional organization of biological systems. Network based on similarity in gene expression are called (gene) co-expression networks. One of the major application of gene co-expression networks is the functional annotation of unknown genes. Constructing co-expression networks is generally straightforward. In contrast, the resulting network of connected genes can become very complex, which limits its biological interpretation. Several strategies can be employed to enhance the interpretation of the networks. A strategy in coherence with the biological question addressed needs to be established to infer reliable networks. Additional benefits can be gained from network-based strategies using prior knowledge and data integration to further enhance the elucidation of gene regulatory relationships. As a result, biological networks provide many more applications beyond the simple visualization of co-expressed genes. In this study we review the different approaches for co-expression network inference in plants. We analyse integrative genomics strategies used in recent studies that successfully identified candidate genes taking advantage of gene co-expression networks. Additionally, we discuss promising bioinformatics approaches that predict networks for specific purposes.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through binding to cis-regulatory specific sequences in the promoters of their target genes. In contrast to the genetic code, the transcriptional regulatory code is far from being deciphered and is determined by sequence specificity of TFs, combinatorial cooperation between TFs and chromatin competence. Here we addressed one of these determinants by characterizing the target sequence specificity of 63 plant TFs representing 25 families, using protein-binding microarrays. Remarkably, almost half of these TFs recognized secondary motifs, which in some cases were completely unrelated to the primary element. Analyses of coregulated genes and transcriptomic data from TFs mutants showed the functional significance of over 80{\%} of all identified sequences and of at least one target sequence per TF. Moreover, combining the target sequence information with coexpression analysis we could predict the function of a TF as activator or repressor through a particular DNA sequence. Our data support the correlation between cis-regulatory elements and the sequence determined in vitro using the protein-binding microarray and provides a framework to explore regulatory networks in plants.},

abstract = {This study integrates gene expression, genotype and drug response data in lymphoblastoid cell lines with transcription factor (TF)-binding sites from ENCODE (Encyclopedia of Genomic Elements) in a novel methodology that elucidates regulatory contexts associated with cytotoxicity. The method, GENMi (Gene Expression iN the Middle), postulates that single-nucleotide polymorphisms within TF-binding sites putatively modulate its regulatory activity, and the resulting variation in gene expression leads to variation in drug response. Analysis of 161 TFs and 24 treatments revealed 334 significantly associated TF-treatment pairs. Investigation of 20 selected pairs yielded literature support for 13 of these associations, often from studies where perturbation of the TF expression changes drug response. Experimental validation of significant GENMi associations in taxanes and anthracyclines across two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines corroborates our findings. The method is shown to be more sensitive than an alternative, genome-wide association study-based approach that does not use gene expression. These results demonstrate the utility of GENMi in identifying TFs that influence drug response and provide a number of candidates for further testing.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 27 October 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.74.},

abstract = {Diseases and phenotypes caused by disrupted transcription factor (TF) binding are being identified, but progress is hampered by our limited capacity to predict such functional alterations. Improving predictions may be dependent on expanding the set of bona fide TF binding alterations. Allele-specific binding (ASB) events, where TFs preferentially bind to one of the two alleles at heterozygous sites, reveal the impact of sequence variations in altered TF binding. Here, we present the largest ASB compilation to our knowledge, 10 765 ASB events retrieved from 45 ENCODE ChIP-Seq data sets. Our analysis showed that ASB events were frequently associated with motif alterations of the ChIP'ed TF and potential partner TFs, allelic difference of DNase I hypersensitivity and allelic difference of histone modifications. For TF dimers bound symmetrically to DNA, ASB data revealed that central positions of the TF binding motifs were disproportionately important for binding. Lastly, the impact of variation on TF binding was predicted by a classification model incorporating all the investigated features of ASB events. Classification models using only DNase I hypersensitivity and sequence data exhibited predictive accuracy approaching the models with substantially more features. Taken together, the combination of ASB data and the classification model represents an important step toward elucidating regulatory variants across the human genome.},

abstract = {Association studies provide genome-wide information about the genetic basis of complex disease, but medical research has focused primarily on protein-coding variants, owing to the difficulty of interpreting noncoding mutations. This picture has changed with advances in the systematic annotation of functional noncoding elements. Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions. Ultimately, advances in regulatory and systems genomics can help unleash the value of whole-genome sequencing for personalized genomic risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.},

It is a classic problem that has eluded a satis-factory and e±cient solution. In this paper, we devise a three-phase algorithm to mine for biologically signi¯cant motifs. In the ¯rst phase, we generate all the possible string motifs, this phase is followed by a ¯ltering process where we discard all motifs that do not meet the constraints. And in the ¯nal phase, motifs are scored and ranked using a combination of stochastic techniques and p-value. We show that our method outperforms some very well-known motif discovery tools, e.g. MEME and Weeder on well-established benchmark data suites. We also apply the algorithm on the non-coding regions of M. tuberculosis and report signi¯cant motifs of size 10 with excellent p-values in a fraction of the time MEME and MoSDi did. In fact, among the best 10 motifs (p-value wise) in the non-coding regions of M. tuberculosis reported by the tools MEME, MoSDi and ours, ¯ve were discovered by our approach which included the third and the fourth best ones. All this in 1/17 and 1/6 the time which MEME and MoSDi (respectively) took.},

abstract = {Background: Most disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) exist in noncoding regions. In spite of the common agreement that such variants may disrupt biological functions of their hosting regulatory elements, it remains a great challenge to characterize the risk of a genetic variant within the implicated genome sequence. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective computational model that is not only capable of predicting the potential risk of a genetic variant but also valid in interpreting how the function of the genome is affected with the occurrence of the variant. Results: We developed a method named kmerForest that used a random forest classifier with k-mer counts to predict accessible chromatin regions purely based on DNA sequences. We demonstrated that our method outperforms existing methods in distinguishing known accessible chromatin regions from random genomic sequences. Furthermore, the performance of our method can further be improved with the incorporation of sequence conservation features. Based on this model, we assessed importance of the k-mer features by a series of permutation experiments, and we characterized the risk of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the function of the genome using the difference between the importance of the k-mer features affected by the occurrence of the SNP. We conducted a series of experiments and showed that our model can well discriminate between pathogenic and normal SNPs. Particularly, our model correctly prioritized SNPs that are proved to be enriched for the binding sites of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines from previous studies. Conclusions: We presented a novel method to interpret functional genetic variants purely base on DNA sequences. The proposed k-mer based score offers an effective means of measuring the impact of SNPs on the function of the genome, and thus shedding light on the identification of genetic risk factors underlying complex traits and diseases.

abstract = {Pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences is a chal-lenging problem in both computer science and molecular biology. Several different methods and techniques have been proposed so far, but in most of the cases signals in DNA sequences are very complicated and avoid detection. Exact exhaustive methods can solve the problem only for short signals with a limited number of mutations. In this work, we extend exhaustive enumeration also to longer patterns. More in detail, the basic version of algorithm pre-sented in this paper, given as input a set of sequences and an error ratio {\textless} 1, finds all patterns that occur in at least q sequences of the set with at most m mutations, where m is the length of the pattern. The only restriction is im-posed on the location of mutations along the signal. That is, a valid occurrence of a pattern can present at most i mismatches in the first i nucleotides, and so on. However, we show how the algorithm can be used also when no as-sumption can be made on the position of mutations. In this case, it is also possible to have an estimate of the proba-bility of finding a signal according to the signal length, the error ratio, and the input parameters. Finally, we discuss some significance measures that can be used to sort the patterns output by the algorithm.},

abstract = {Most variants implicated in common human disease by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie in noncoding sequence intervals. Despite the suggestion that regulatory element disruption represents a common theme, identifying causal risk variants within implicated genomic regions remains a major challenge. Here we present a new sequence-based computational method to predict the effect of regulatory variation, using a classifier (gkm-SVM) that encodes cell type-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies. The induced change in the gkm-SVM score, deltaSVM, quantifies the effect of variants. We show that deltaSVM accurately predicts the impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic contexts and accurately predicts the results of dense mutagenesis of several enhancers in reporter assays. Previously validated GWAS SNPs yield large deltaSVM scores, and we predict new risk-conferring SNPs for several autoimmune diseases. Thus, deltaSVM provides a powerful computational approach to systematically identify functional regulatory variants.},

abstract = {Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and play important roles in controlling the expres-sion levels of their target genes. Hence, prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) provides a solid foundation for inferring gene regulatory mechanisms and building regulatory networks for a genome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology can generate large-scale experimental data for such protein–DNA interactions, providing an unprecedented opportunity to identify TFBSs (a.k.a. cis-regulatory motifs). The bottleneck, however, is the lack of robust mathematical models, as well as efficient computational methods for TFBS prediction to make effective use of massive ChIP-seq data sets in the public domain. The purpose of this study is to review existing motif-finding methods for ChIP-seq data from an algorithmic perspective and provide new computational insight into this field. The state-of-the-art methods were shown through summarizing eight representative motif-finding algorithms along with corresponding challenges, and introducing some important relative functions according to specific biological demands, including discriminative motif finding and cofactor motifs analysis. Finally, potential directions and plans for ChIP-seq-based motif-finding tools were showcased in support of future algorithm development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND This paper explores the application of alternative approaches to economic evaluation of public health interventions, using a worked example of exercise referral schemes (ERSs). METHODS Cost-utility (CUA) and cost-consequence analyses (CCA) were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of ERSs. For the CUA, evidence was synthesized using a decision analytic model that adopts a lifetime horizon and NHS/Personal Social Services perspective. Outcomes were expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). CCA was conducted from a partial-societal perspective, including health and non-healthcare costs and benefits. Outcomes were reported in natural units, such as cases of strokes or CHD avoided. RESULTS Compared with usual care, the incremental cost per QALY of ERS is {\pounds}20 876. Based on a cohort of 100 000 individuals, CCA estimates cost of ERS at {\pounds}22 million to the healthcare provider and {\pounds}12 million to participants. The benefits of ERS include additional 3900 people becoming physically active, 51 cases of CHD avoided, 16 cases of stroke avoided, 86 cases of diabetes avoided and a gain of ∼800 QALYs. CONCLUSIONS CCA might provide greater transparency than CUA in reporting the outcomes of public health interventions and have greater resonance with stakeholders involved in commissioning these interventions.},

abstract = {The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

abstract = {It is now well established that noncoding regulatory variants play a central role in the genetics of common diseases and in evolution. However, until recently, we have known little about the mechanisms by which most regulatory variants act. For instance, what types of functional elements in DNA, RNA, or proteins are most often affected by regulatory variants? Which stages of gene regulation are typically altered? How can we predict which variants are most likely to impact regulation in a given cell type? Recent studies, in many cases using quantitative trait loci (QTL)-mapping approaches in cell lines or tissue samples, have provided us with considerable insight into the properties of genetic loci that have regulatory roles. Such studies have uncovered novel biochemical regulatory interactions and led to the identification of previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms. We have learned that genetic variation is often directly associated with variation in regulatory activities (namely, we can map regulatory QTLs, not just expression QTLs [eQTLs]), and we have taken the first steps towards understanding the causal order of regulatory events (for example, the role of pioneer transcription factors). Yet, in most cases, we still do not know how to interpret overlapping combinations of regulatory interactions, and we are still far from being able to predict how variation in regulatory mechanisms is propagated through a chain of interactions to eventually result in changes in gene expression profiles.},

abstract = {By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%} in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

abstract = {Grounded theory, as an evolving qualitative research method, is a product of its history as well as of its epistemology.Within the literature, there have been a number of discussions focusing on the differences between Glaser's (1978, 1992) and Strauss's (1987, 1990) ver- sions of grounded theory. The purpose of this article is to add a level of depth and breadth to this discussion through specifically exploring the Glaser-Strauss debate by comparing the data analysis processes and procedures advocated by Glaser and by Strauss. To accomplish this task, the authors present the article in two sections. First, they provide relevant back- ground information on grounded theory as a research method. Second, they pursue a more in-depth discussion of the positions of Glaser, using Glaser's work, and Strauss, using Strauss's and Strauss and Corbin's (1990) work, regarding the different phases of data analysis, specifically addressing the coding procedures, verification, and the issue of forcing versus emergence.},

abstract = {Motivation: Pattern discovery algorithms are widely used for the analysis of DNA and protein sequences. Most algorithms have been designed to find overrepresented motifs in sparse datasets of long sequences, and ignore most positional information. We introduce an algorithm optimized to exploit spatial information in sparse-but-populous datasets. Results: Our algorithm Tree-based Weighted-Position Pattern Discovery and Classification (T-WPPDC) supports both unsupervised pattern discovery and supervised sequence classification. It identifies positionally enriched patterns using the Kullback– Leibler distance between foreground and background sequences at each position. This spatial information is used to discover positionally important patterns. T-WPPDC then uses a scoring function to discriminate different biological classes. We validated T-WPPDC on an important biological problem: prediction of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from flanking sequence. We evaluated 672 separate experiments on 120 datasets derived from multiple species. T-WPPDC outperformed other pattern discovery methods and was comparable to the supervised machine learning algorithms. The algorithm is computationally efficient and largely insensitive to dataset size. It allows arbitrary parameterization and is embarrassingly parallelizable. Conclusions: T-WPPDC is a minimally parameterized algorithm for both pattern discovery and sequence classification that directly incorporates positional information. We use it to confirm the predictability of SNPs from flanking sequence, and show that positional information is a key to this biological problem.},

abstract = {The rejection of reliability and validity in qualitative inquiry in the 1980s has resulted in an interesting shift for "ensuring rigor" from the investigator's actions during the course of the research, to the reader or consumer of qualitative inquiry. The emphasis on strategies that are implemented during the research process has been replaced by strategies for evaluating trustworthiness and utility that are implemented once a study is completed. In this article, we argue that reliability and validity remain appropriate concepts for attaining rigor in qualitative research. We argue that qualitative researchers should reclaim responsibility for reliability and validity by implementing verification strategies integral and self-correcting during the conduct of inquiry itself. This ensures the attainment of rigor using strategies inherent within each qualitative design, and moves the responsibility for incorporating and maintaining reliability and validity from external reviewers' judgements to the investigators themselves. Finally, we make a plea for a return to terminology for ensuring rigor that is used by mainstream science.},

abstract = {Enormous progress in mapping complex traits in humans has been made in the last 5 yr. There has been early success for prevalent diseases with complex phenotypes. These studies have demonstrated clearly that, while complex traits differ in their underlying genetic architectures, for many common disorders the predominant pattern is that of many loci, individually with small effects on phenotype. For some traits, loci of large effect have been identified. For almost all complex traits studied in humans, the sum of the identified genetic effects comprises only a portion, generally less than half, of the estimated trait heritability. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain why this might be the case, including untested rare variants, and gene-gene and gene-environment interaction. Effort is currently being directed toward implementation of novel analytic approaches and testing rare variants for association with complex traits using imputed variants from the publicly available 1000 Genomes Project resequencing data and from direct resequencing of clinical samples. Through integration with annotations and functional genomic data as well as by in vitro and in vivo experimentation, mapping studies continue to characterize functional variants associated with complex traits and address fundamental issues such as epistasis and pleiotropy. This review focuses primarily on the ways in which genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized the field of human quantitative genetics.},

While studies of TF–DNA binding have focused on TFs' intrinsic preferences for primary nucleotide sequence motifs, recent studies have elucidated additional layers of complexity that modulate TF–DNA binding. In this review, we discuss technological developments for identifying TF binding preferences and highlight recent discoveries that elaborate how TF interactions, local DNA structure, and genomic features influence TF–DNA binding. We highlight novel approaches for characterizing functional binding site motifs that promise to inform our understanding of how TF binding controls gene expression and ultimately contributes to phenotype.},

Clinically defined largely through bone mineral density, osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures have reasonably high heritabilities, prompting much effort to identify the genetic determinants of this disease. Genome-wide association studies have recently provided rapid insights into the allelic architecture of this condition, identifying 62 genome-wide-significant loci. Here, we review how these new loci provide an opportunity to explore how the genetics of osteoporosis can elucidate its pathophysiology, provide drug targets and allow for prediction of future fracture risk.},

abstract = {Gene discovery, estimation of heritability captured by SNP arrays, inference on genetic architecture and prediction analyses of complex traits are usually performed using different statistical models and methods, leading to inefficiency and loss of power. Here we use a Bayesian mixture model that simultaneously allows variant discovery, estimation of genetic variance explained by all variants and prediction of unobserved phenotypes in new samples. We apply the method to simulated data of quantitative traits and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data on disease and show that it provides accurate estimates of SNP-based heritability, produces unbiased estimators of risk in new samples, and that it can estimate genetic architecture by partitioning variation across hundreds to thousands of SNPs. We estimated that, depending on the trait, 2,633 to 9,411 SNPs explain all of the SNP-based heritability in the WTCCC diseases. The majority of those SNPs ({\textgreater}96{\%}) had small effects, confirming a substantial polygenic component to common diseases. The proportion of the SNP-based variance explained by large effects (each SNP explaining 1{\%} of the variance) varied markedly between diseases, ranging from almost zero for bipolar disorder to 72{\%} for type 1 diabetes. Prediction analyses demonstrate that for diseases with major loci, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Bayesian methods outperform profile scoring or mixed model approaches.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have confirmed the involvement of non-coding angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) gene variants with coronary artery disease, levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and ANGPTL3 mRNA transcript. Extensive linkage disequilibrium at the locus, however, has hindered efforts to identify the potential functional variants. Using regulatory annotations from ENCODE, combined with functional in vivo assays such as allele-specific formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements, statistical approaches including eQTL/lipid colocalisation, and traditional in vitro methodologies including electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter assays, variants affecting the ANGPTL3 regulome were examined. From 253 variants associated with ANGPTL3 mRNA expression, and/or lipid traits, 46 were located within liver regulatory elements and potentially functional. One variant, rs10889352, demonstrated allele-specific effects on DNA-protein interactions, reporter gene expression and chromatin accessibility, in line with effects on LDL-C levels and expression of ANGPTL3 mRNA. The ANGPTL3 gene lies within DOCK7, although the variant is within non-coding regions outside of ANGPTL3, within DOCK7, suggesting complex long-range regulatory effects on gene expression. This study illustrates the power of combining multiple genome-wide datasets with laboratory data to localise functional non-coding variation and provides a model for analysis of regulatory variants from GWAS.},

Genetic association studies provide a powerful approach to discover new genes, biological pathways and mechanisms underlying haematopoietic development. Here, we highlight recent findings of genomewide association studies (GWAS) linking 145 genomic loci to traits affecting the formation of red and white cells and platelets in European and other ancestries. We present strategies to address the main challenges in GWAS discoveries, particularly to find functional and regulatory effects of genetic variants, and to identify genes through which these genetic variants affect haematological phenotypes. We argue that studies of haematological trait variation provide an ideal paradigm for understanding the function of GWAS-associated variants owing to the accessible nature of cells, simple cellular phenotype and focused efforts to characterize the genetic and epigenetic factors influencing the regulatory landscape in highly pure mature cell populations.},

The most highly heritable genes ( approximately 777) were grouped into distinct expression clusters, enriched in gene-poor regions, associated with specific gene function or ontology classes, and strongly associated with disease designation. The design enabled a comparison of twin-based heritability to estimates based on dizygotic identity-by-descent sharing and distant genetic relatedness. Consideration of sampling variation suggests that previous heritability estimates have been upwardly biased. Genotyping of 2,494 twins enabled powerful identification of eQTLs, which we further examined in a replication set of 1,895 unrelated subjects. A large number of non-redundant local eQTLs (6,756) met replication criteria, whereas a relatively small number of distant eQTLs (165) met quality control and replication standards. Our results provide a new resource toward understanding the genetic control of transcription.},

TFs recognize DNA in a specific manner; the mechanisms underlying this specificity have been identified for many TFs based on 3D structures of protein-DNA complexes. More recently, structural views have been complemented with data from high-throughput in vitro and in vivo explorations of the DNA-binding preferences of many TFs. Together, these approaches have greatly expanded our understanding of TF-DNA interactions. However, the mechanisms by which TFs select in vivo binding sites and alter gene expression remain unclear. Recent work has highlighted the many variables that influence TF-DNA binding, while demonstrating that a biophysical understanding of these many factors will be central to understanding TF function. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping tackles the problem of identifying variation in DNA sequence that have an effect on the transcriptional regulatory network. Major computational efforts are aimed at characterizing the joint effects of several eQTLs acting in concert to govern the expression of the same genes. Yet, progress toward a comprehensive prediction of such joint effects is limited. For example, existing eQTL methods commonly discover interacting loci affecting the expression levels of a module of co-regulated genes. Such "modularization" approaches, however, are focused on epistatic relations and thus have limited utility for the case of additive (non-epistatic) effects. RESULTS Here we present POEM (Pairwise effect On Expression Modules), a methodology for identifying pairwise eQTL effects on gene modules. POEM is specifically designed to achieve high performance in the case of additive joint effects. We applied POEM to transcription profiles measured in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells across a population of genotyped mice. Our study reveals widespread additive, trans-acting pairwise effects on gene modules, characterizes their organizational principles, and highlights high-order interconnections between modules within the immune signaling network. These analyses elucidate the central role of additive pairwise effect in regulatory circuits, and provide computational tools for future investigations into the interplay between eQTLs.

abstract = {The MEME algorithm extends the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for identifying motifs in unaligned biopolymer sequences. The aim of MEME is to discover new motifs in a set of biopolymer sequences where little or nothing is known in advance about any motifs that may be present. MEME innovations expand the range of problems which can be solved using EM and increase the chance of finding good Solutions. First, subseqnences which actually occur in the biopolymer sequences are used as starting points for the EM algorithm to increase the probability of finding globally optimal motifs. Second, the assumption that each sequence contains-exactly one occurrence of the shared motif is removed. This allows multiple appearances of a motif to occur in any sequence and permits the algorithm to ignore sequences with no appearance of the shared motif, increasing its resistance to noisy data. Third, a method for probabilistically erasing shared motifs after they are found is incorporated so that several distinct motifs can be found in the same set of sequences, both when different motifs appear in different sequences and when a single sequence may contain multiple motifs. Experiments show that MEME can discover both the CRP and LexA binding sites from a set of sequences which contain one or both sites, and that MEME can discover both the -10 and -35 promoter regions in a set of E. coli sequences.},

We describe a comprehensive and simplifying view of how position in 1D sequence and 3D nuclear space underlies expression. We suggest that apparently-different regulatory motifs including enhancers, silencers, insulators, barriers, and boundaries act similarly - they are active promoters that tether target genes close to, or distant from, appropriate transcription sites or 'factories'.

abstract = {The contraction pattern of the heart relies on the activation and conduction of the electrical impulse. Perturbations of cardiac conduction have been associated with congenital and acquired arrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest. The pattern of conduction depends on the regulation of heterogeneous gene expression by key transcription factors and transcriptional enhancers. Here, we assessed the genome-wide occupation of conduction system-regulating transcription factors TBX3, NKX2-5, and GATA4 and of enhancer-associated coactivator p300 in the mouse heart, uncovering cardiac enhancers throughout the genome. Many of the enhancers colocalized with ion channel genes repressed by TBX3, including the clustered sodium channel genes Scn5a, essential for cardiac function, and Scn10a. We identified 2 enhancers in the Scn5a/Scn10a locus, which were regulated by TBX3 and its family member and activator, TBX5, and are functionally conserved in humans. We also provided evidence that a SNP in the SCN10A enhancer associated with alterations in cardiac conduction patterns in humans disrupts TBX3/TBX5 binding and reduces the cardiac activity of the enhancer in vivo. Thus, the identification of key regulatory elements for cardiac conduction helps to explain how genetic variants in noncoding regulatory DNA sequences influence the regulation of cardiac conduction and the predisposition for cardiac arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

abstract = {Mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has been shown as a powerful tool to uncover the genetic underpinnings of many complex traits at molecular level. In this paper, we present an integrative analysis approach that leverages eQTL data collected from multiple population groups. In particular, our approach effectively identifies multiple independent cis-eQTL signals that are consistent across populations, accounting for population heterogeneity in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns. Furthermore, by integrating genomic annotations, our analysis framework enables high-resolution functional analysis of eQTLs. We applied our statistical approach to analyze the GEUVADIS data consisting of samples from five population groups. From this analysis, we concluded that i) jointly analysis across population groups greatly improves the power of eQTL discovery and the resolution of fine mapping of causal eQTL ii) many genes harbor multiple independent eQTLs in their cis regions iii) genetic variants that disrupt transcription factor binding are significantly enriched in eQTLs (p-value = 4.93 × 10(-22)).},

Of the 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05), 2,743 (12{\%}) showed context-dependent eQTL effects. The majority of these effects were influenced by cell type composition. A set of 145 cis-eQTLs depended on type I interferon signaling.

To express a gene in a specific coding region, the chromatin would open up and DNA loop may be formed by interacting enhancers and promoters. Furthermore, the mediator and cohesion complexes, sequence-specific transcription factors, and RNA polymerase II are recruited and work together to elaborately regulate the expression level. It is in pressing need to understand how the information, about when, where, and to what degree genes should be expressed, is embedded into chromatin structure and gene regulatory elements. Thanks to large consortia such as Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and Roadmap Epigenomic projects, extensive data on chromatin accessibility and transcript abundance are available across many tissues and cell types. This rich data offer an exciting opportunity to model the causal regulatory relationship. Here, we will review the current experimental approaches, foundational data, computational problems, interpretive frameworks, and integrative models that will enable the accurate interpretation of regulatory landscape. Particularly, we will discuss the efforts to organize, analyze, model, and integrate the DNA accessibility data, transcriptional data, and functional genomic regions together. We believe that these efforts will eventually help us understand the information flow within the cell and will influence research directions across many fields.},

Given the number of genome-wide significant variants that fall outside of coding regions, it is possible that some of these variants alter some function of gene expression rather than tagging coding variants that alter protein structure and/or function. RegulomeDB is a database that annotates regulatory functions of genetic variants. In this study, we utilized RegulomeDB to investigate potential regulatory functions of lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in five genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of risk and age-at onset (AAO) of LOAD, as well as SNPs in LD (r2≥0.80) with the lead GWAS SNPs. Of a total 614 SNPs examined, 394 returned RegulomeDB scores of 1-6. Of those 394 variants, 34 showed strong evidence of regulatory function (RegulomeDB score {\textless}3), and only 3 of them were genome-wide significant SNPs (ZCWPW1/rs1476679, CLU/rs1532278 and ABCA7/rs3764650). This study further supports the assumption that some of the non-coding GWAS SNPs are true associations rather than tagged associations and demonstrates the application of RegulomeDB to GWAS data.},

abstract = {Motivation: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expres-sion of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodo-logy of gene set testing. Results: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.

Transcriptional regulation is typically mediated by distinct combinations of TFs, enabling a relatively small number of TFs to generate a large diversity of cell types. However, how TFs achieve combinatorial enhancer control and how enhancers, enhancer-bound TFs, and the cofactors they recruit regulate RNA Polymerase II activity is not entirely clear. Here, we review how TF synergy is mediated at the level of DNA binding and after binding, the role of cofactors and the post-translational modifications they catalyze, and discuss different models of enhancer—core-promoter communication.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes contain a variety of structured patterns: repetitive elements, binding sites of DNA and RNA associated proteins, splice sites and so on. Often, these structured patterns can be formalized as motifs and described using a proper mathematical model such as position weight matrix and IUPAC consensus. Two key tasks are typically carried out for motifs in the context of the analysis of genomic sequences. These are: identification in a set of DNA regions of over-represented motifs from a particular motif database, and de novo discovery of over-represented motifs. Here we describe existing methodology to perform these two tasks for motifs characterizing transcription factor binding. When applied to the output of ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments, or to promoter regions of co-modulated genes, motif analysis techniques allow for the prediction of transcription factor binding events and enable identification of transcriptional regulators and co-regulators. The usefulness of motif analysis is further exemplified in this review by how motif discovery improves peak calling in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments and, when coupled with information on gene expression, allows insights into physical mechanisms of transcriptional modulation.},

abstract = {The advent of high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) has accelerated the pace of discovery of disease-associated genetic variants and genomewide profiling of expressed sequences and epigenetic marks, thereby permitting systems-based analyses of ocular development and disease. Rapid evolution of NGS and associated methodologies presents significant challenges in acquisition, management, and analysis of large data sets and for extracting biologically or clinically relevant information. Here we illustrate the basic design of commonly used NGS-based methods, specifically whole exome sequencing, transcriptome, and epigenome profiling, and provide recommendations for data analyses. We briefly discuss systems biology approaches for integrating multiple data sets to elucidate gene regulatory or disease networks. While we provide examples from the retina, the NGS guidelines reviewed here are applicable to other tissues/cell types as well.},

abstract = {Epistasis (synergistic interaction) among SNPs governing gene expression is likely to arise within transcriptional networks. However, the power to detect it is limited by the large number of combinations to be tested and the modest sample sizes of most datasets. By limiting the interaction search space firstly to cis-trans and then cis-cis SNP pairs where both SNPs had an independent effect on the expression of the most variable transcripts in the liver and brain, we greatly reduced the size of the search space. Within the cis-trans search space we discovered three transcripts with significant epistasis. Surprisingly, all interacting SNP pairs were located nearby each other on the chromosome (within 290 kb-2.16 Mb). Despite their proximity, the interacting SNPs were outside the range of linkage disequilibrium (LD), which was absent between the pairs (r2 {\textless} 0.01). Accordingly, we redefined the search space to detect cis-cis interactions, where a cis-SNP was located within 10 Mb of the target transcript. The results of this show evidence for the epistatic regulation of 50 transcripts across the tissues studied. Three transcripts, namely, HLA-G, PSORS1C1 and HLA-DRB5 share common regulatory SNPs in the pre-frontal cortex and their expression is significantly correlated. This pattern of epistasis is consistent with mediation via long-range chromatin structures rather than the binding of transcription factors in trans. Accordingly, some of the interactions map to regions of the genome known to physically interact in lymphoblastoid cell lines while others map to known promoter and enhancer elements. SNPs involved in interactions appear to be enriched for promoter markers. In the context of gene expression and its regulation, our analysis indicates that the study of cis-cis or local epistatic interactions may have a more important role than interchromosomal interactions.},

abstract = {Gene expression at the level of transcription is regulated by a set of transcription factors (TFs) that recognizes cis elements. We accessed the human promoters from eukaryotic promoter database. These sequences have been run in P-match tool. MEME software has been used for detection of conserved sequences in the promoter region. All the predicted known TFs and their binding sites along with weight matrices were collected from TRANSFAC database under vertebrate TFs category. P-match tool combines pattern matching and weight matrix approaches thus providing higher accuracy of recognition than each of the methods alone. P-Match is closely interconnected with the TRANSFAC{\textregistered} database. Using results of extensive tests of recognition accuracy, we selected three sets of optimized cut-off values that minimize either false negatives or false positives, or the sum of both errors. In this report, we focus on those polymorphisms of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the regulatory region of host genes and hypothesize that these variation increases the susceptibility/resistance to a particular disease by alteration of gene product in the cell. Therefore, we have concluded that 124 promoter polymorphisms in the 9 genes involved in malaria pathogenesis play important role in susceptibility to falciparum malaria.},

@article{Ong2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Health economics is increasingly used to inform resource allocation decision-making, however, there is comparatively little evidence relevant to minority groups. In part, this is due to lack of cost and effectiveness data specific to these groups upon which economic evaluations can be based. Consequently, resource allocation decisions often rely on mainstream evidence which may not be representative, resulting in inequitable funding decisions. This paper describes a method to overcome this deficiency for Australia's Indigenous population. A template has been developed which can adapt mainstream health intervention data to the Indigenous setting. METHODS The 'Indigenous Health Service Delivery Template' has been constructed using mixed methods, which include literature review, stakeholder discussions and key informant interviews. The template quantifies the differences in intervention delivery between best practice primary health care for the Indigenous population via Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs), and mainstream general practitioner (GP) practices. Differences in costs and outcomes have been identified, measured and valued. This template can then be used to adapt mainstream health intervention data to allow its economic evaluation as if delivered from an ACCHS. RESULTS The template indicates that more resources are required in the delivery of health interventions via ACCHSs, due to their comprehensive nature. As a result, the costs of such interventions are greater, however this is accompanied by greater benefits due to improved health service access. In the example case of the polypill intervention, 58{\%} more costs were involved in delivery via ACCHSs, with 50{\%} more benefits. Cost-effectiveness ratios were also altered accordingly. CONCLUSIONS The Indigenous Health Service Delivery Template reveals significant differences in the way health interventions are delivered from ACCHSs compared to mainstream GP practices. It is important that these differences are included in the conduct of economic evaluations to ensure results are relevant to Indigenous Australians. Similar techniques would be generalisable to other disadvantaged minority populations. This will allow resource allocation decision-makers access to economic evidence that more accurately represents the needs and context of disadvantaged groups, which is particularly important if addressing health inequities is a stated goal.},

abstract = {The DNA motif discovery problem abstracts the task of discovering short, conserved sites in genomic DNA. Pevzner and Sze recently described a precise combinatorial formulation of motif discovery that motivates the following algorithmic challenge: nd twenty planted occurrences of a motif of length fteen in roughly twelve kilobases of genomic sequence, where each occurrence of the motif differs from its consensus in four randomly chosen positions. Such " subtle " motifs, though statistically highly signi cant, expose a weakness in existing motif-nding algorithms, which typically fail to discover them. Pevzner and Sze introduced new algorithms to solve their (15,4)-motif challenge, but these methods do not scale ef ciently to more dif cult problems in the same family, such as the (14,4)-, (16,5)-, and (18,6)-motif problems. We introduce a novel motif-discovery algorithm, PROJECTION, de-signed to enhance the performance of existing motif nders using random projections of the input's substrings. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that PROJECTION reme-dies the weakness observed in existing algorithms, typically solving the dif cult (14,4)-, (16,5)-, and (18,6)-motif problems. Our algorithm is robust to nonuniform background se-quence distributions and scales to larger amounts of sequence than that speci ed in the original challenge. A probabilistic estimate suggests that related motif-nding problems that PROJECTION fails to solve are in all likelihood inherently intractable. We also test the performance of our algorithm on realistic biological examples, including transcription factor binding sites in eukaryotes and ribosome binding sites in prokaryotes.},
